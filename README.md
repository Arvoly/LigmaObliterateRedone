# Ligma Obliterate Redone Version

Replaces the interact text at the obliteration obelisk and the Unknown Fate death message.

Based on [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/riskofrain/comments/r49747/its_so_sad_steven_jobarony_played_risk_of_rain/) by [/u/beanboy10101](https://www.reddit.com/user/beanboy10101).

This is a redone version of [this RoR2 Mod]

I will be adding a sound effect when you get Obliterated in the future, when I finally figure out how to do it.
